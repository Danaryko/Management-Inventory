## Implementation Details

### Routes Updated (`routes/web.php`)
```php
// Activity History (Admin, Manager, Operator access)
Route::middleware('roles:admin,manager,operator')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/activities', [ActivityController::class, 'index'])->name('activities.index');
    Route::get('/activities/export', [ActivityController::class, 'export'])->name('activities.export');
});

// Dashboard with role-based controller
Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
```

### Database Considerations
- Existing Activity model and migration used
- No database changes required
- Optimized queries for better performance

### Security Features
- Role-based access control maintained
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure export functionality

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. Access Activity History from sidebar
2. View all system activities
3. Use filters to find specific activities
4. Export data for analysis
5. Monitor system-wide statistics on dashboard

### For Managers:
1. View team activities and performance
2. Filter activities by team members
